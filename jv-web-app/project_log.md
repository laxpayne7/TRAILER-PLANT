## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ HTML Skeleton Created
- Full `index.html` layout built with 11 modular sections
- Dynamic component loader set up for Working Capital Simulator
- Integrated calculator module from `/modules/calculator` with HTML/CSS/JS injection
- Section 2 now fully functional with existing simulator logic


## ✅ Current Status (as of 2025-06-27)
- Planning Document Finalized (Canvas: "JV Web Interface Layout")
- Development workflow established using ChatGPT + Git + VS Code
- Web interface will be operated live by Partner C during JV meetings
- Phase 1 build approach defined:
  - Page Skeleton → Section Selection → Placeholder UI → Component Development
- ProjectLog.md created to track each modular milestone

## 📅 2025-06-27

### ✅ Planning Complete
- All 11 interface sections finalized with layout, purpose, and components
- Working Capital Simulator repositioned as Section 2 (due to dependency on operational inputs)
- Contribution Builder made dynamic, syncing directly with simulator output
- Workflow for development (ChatGPT-driven, Git-tracked) established and approved

### ✅ Setup Strategy Finalized
- Will use Canvas for code tracking and modular edits
- Local repo in VS Code using Git for changes and backup
- I (Partner C) will operate the interface during partner meetings and lead finalization of MoU

### 🧠 Design Notes
- Simulator output influences capital contribution and equity logic (real-data-driven)
- MoU Builder will generate legal document dynamically from agreed section inputs
- Modular layout enables partner-specific negotiations before joint finalization

### 🔄 Next Step
- Generate complete HTML5 skeleton layout with section containers and IDs
- Link style and script files for modular expansion

## 📝 Dev Notes
- ProjectLog.md will be updated **after each significant development step** or partner review
- Use short, clear notes with date headers to track changes across Git and ChatGPT sessions
- This file acts as external memory and development anchor when switching workspaces
